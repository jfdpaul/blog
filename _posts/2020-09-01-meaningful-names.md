I want to take this opportunity to apologise for all the codes I wrote which troubles my fellow coders even to this day.

## Bad code is a bad headache
So what is meant by bad code? Have you ever written code which you have difficulty understanding after two or three months? This is a good candidate for bad code.

In simple words, unreadable code, smells! Codes should be written like well written prose (borrowed phrase).

When you are reading a software's code, this is how you should go about it:
- Understand the problem the software is trying to solve
- Take the code and find which module does what task
- Then read code in each module to understand how these tasks are achieved

If point number 3 is creating a problem for you. That means the code is not written well enough.
- It's not readable
- It's not broken into meaningful functions
- It's function names and function parameters are not meaningful in the context
- It's got too many branches in the same function
- It's has not employed the right design patterns
