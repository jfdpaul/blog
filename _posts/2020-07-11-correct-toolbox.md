## Premise
I cannot stress enough to tell you how important is it to have the right set of tools for the job. Let me try!

Right from the simplest professions to the most high skilled ones, they all need you to have the right set of tools while on the job

Imagine a painter with only one brush! A painter has different burshes for each stroke. A farmer has a sickle, a sweeper has a broom, an accountant has a balance sheet and a mountain climber has ropes.

What I'm trying to say is, you need to equip yourself with the tools of the trade. These will enhance your productivity and reduce your effort.

## What tools should I have as a Software Engineer ?
As a software engineer one should start with a shallow understanding of the ecosystem of the work at hand.

I'll take web applications  as an example.
- You should know how the web (of computers) works. This in itself is a huge topic. So start small
- Understand server vs client (browsers and servers)
- Understand database servers
- Languages used to make websites/webapps possible
- Clientside vs serverside programming
- Security aspects

## The tools in SE
Once we understand this we need to develop softwares. You can use a text editor and type every character. Or use an IDE which not only automates repeated codes, but also aids you to improve your coding style and quality.

For the database, have a client to interact with it graphically rather than opting for a CLI

For source control, ensure you know the basic commands. Or you can use GUI for it too

Try using dotenv to setup your necessary tools

This habit of setting up your tools before approaching your work will at first seem to be painstakingly hard. But you can thank me later for the amount of time it will save you in future.

I used to even automate opening of my IDEs and other tools on system startup
